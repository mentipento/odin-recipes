    <h1>Pumpkin Pie</h1> <img src="pumpkin-pie.jpg" alt="pumpkin pie" width="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This homemade pumpkin pie made with mashed, cooked pumpkin is my family's favorite. Skip the canned pumpkin and store-bought crust and make your holiday pumpkin pie from scratch with a flaky homemade pastry crust and a deliciously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family does! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pastry Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup cold butter or shortening</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 ½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
        <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
